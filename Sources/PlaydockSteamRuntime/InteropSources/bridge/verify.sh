# Check the bridge holds exactly what a launch consumes, and nothing else.
#
#   ./verify.sh          report what is missing, unexpected, or present
#   ./verify.sh --prune  also move anything unexpected out to scratch/bridge-attic
#
# The bridge is the staging area RUN_SCRIPT installs from on every launch, so what
# sits in it ends up in the CrossOver tree, the wine prefix, and the Steam client
# directory. Stray files there are not harmless:
#
# - legacycompat is copied by glob, so anything dropped in it is installed into the
#   Steam client directory verbatim.
# - a stale lsteamclient.so or steamclient64.so beside a PE of the same name makes
#   wine bind that builtin to the old unix half instead of loading the dll.
# - a wrong-arch PE on WINEDLLPATH aborts builtin lookup outright with c000007b.
#
# Backups belong outside the bridge for the same reason, which is why --prune moves
# rather than deletes: the attic is in scratch, which is disposable.
#
# Every file here is reproducible. The built ones come from make lsteamclient,
# make steam-shim and make ntdll-patch. The Valve ones come from the Steam client
# packages, fetched by fetch-valve.sh beside this script.
