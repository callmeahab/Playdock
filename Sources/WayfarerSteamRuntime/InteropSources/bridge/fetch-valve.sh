#!/bin/sh
# Fetch the Valve binaries the bridge stages, from Valve's client packages.
#
#   ./fetch.sh            download, verify every hash, report
#   ./fetch.sh --install  also copy them into the bridge
#
# The ten Valve files in the bridge come from two pinned Steam client packages. The
# pins, the CDN hosts and every file hash live in the manifest this reads, which the
# app reads as a bundled resource too, so there is one definition rather than one per
# consumer. That file also records where the package names come from, and why two of
# the paths inside the packages look misplaced.
#
# The shim once linked steam_api.dll and steam_api64.dll, which are in no client
# package and could not be fetched. That dependency is gone: steam.cpp loads
# steamclient64.dll and calls its CreateInterface instead, so every payload file is
# either built here or fetchable.
